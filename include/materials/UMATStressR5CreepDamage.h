/**
 * Coupling material to use Abaqus UMAT models in MOOSE
 * with phase field damage
 * 
 * This is a variant of UMATStressDamage in which the fracture energy
 * is degraded based on the R5 creep damage criterion, which is based on
 * ductility exhaustion theory.
 * 
 * The damage model is reported in:
 * 
 * M. W. Spindler,
 * The prediction of creep damage in type 347 weld metal. 
 * Part I: the determination of material properties from creep and tensile tests
 * International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping
 * Volume 82, Issue 3, March 2005, Pages 175-184
